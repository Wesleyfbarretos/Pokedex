![Preview-Screens](https://github.com/Wesleyfbarretos/Pokedex/blob/main/src/images/Dex-print.png)

For pokemon lovers, I have developed a very cozy pokedex for them to meet their favorite pokemons and many others. ðŸ˜„.

## Functionalities

- You can search for pokemons by type and name, or both together.
- if you no longer want to filter by type or name, you can reset it by clicking the "Reset" button.
- _I am working on more features_
